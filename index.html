    <h1>League of Legends</h1>

    <p>League of Legends is one of the most popular video games to date and has a tremendous playerbase with over <a href="https://leaguefeed.net/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/" target="_blank">1 million monthly players.</a>The unfortunate reality however is that <a href="https://screenrant.com/league-legends-survey-harassment-toxicity-riot-games-everyone/" target="_blank">most players have had rather negative experiences in game.</a>However, if you still intend to join the game due to the popular new Netflix series Arcane you are going to need to figure out what playstyle best suits you. </p>

    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>With the 157 current chmampions in league of legens it can be a daunting task to figure out which champions to start out with, especially since you need to unlock characters in order to play them. Knowing what playstyle champions have and what playstyle sounds enjoyabe to you can make such choices easier. The classes in league are comprised of the following and their respective subclasses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Controller<ul>
             <li>Enchanter</li>
             <li>Catcher</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Fighter<ul>
            <li>Juggernaut</li>
            <li>Diver</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Mage<ul>
            <li>Burst</li>
            <li>Battlemage</li>
            <li>Artillery</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Marksman</li>
        <li>Slayer<ul>
            <li>Assassin</li>
            <li>Skirmisher</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Tank<ul>
            <li>Vanguard</li>
            <li>Warden</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Specialist</li>

    </ul>
    <p>I won't go into depth on all the classes due to laziness, but in general slayers, tanks, fighters, and battlemages seek to be in close proximity with their opponents while the opposite is true of Controllers, Marksman, and the other mages. Specialists are oddballs and play uniquely based on the champion. I recommend for new players to start with ARAM, a game mode acronym which stands for all random all mid. This mode allows for players to experience playing many different champions and find what champions they like and dislike while also generally being less toxic than the other game modes, allowing you to learn the game before encountering teammates that will make you want to uninstall. Also blep Kench is the best emote. </p>
